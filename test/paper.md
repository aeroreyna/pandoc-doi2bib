# How to use Markdown for Scientific Articles.

One important aspect of scientific articles is the reference to published works which acts as a knowledge foundation for novel research.

For example the work [@DOI:10.1504/IJSI.2013.055801] is one of the recent endeavor to explore the computational complexity of metaheuristic algorithms.
Novel attempts in this matter should recognize and elaborate over this previous work.
As it points to previous works [@DOI:10.1145/937503.937505] as well.

Now if I add another reference like [@DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2014.11.035], what happened?

[@DOI:10.1109/TVT.2018.2799568] as [@DOI:10.1016/j.engappai.2017.06.004]

[@DOI:10.1109/COMST.2015.2439636] This work lead to technical difficulties
